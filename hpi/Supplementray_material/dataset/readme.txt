Here is the discription of the dataset used in the project titled "Issues in performance evaluation for host–pathogen protein interaction prediction"

This dataset contains two directories containing following protein interaction datasets
1- Human HIV protein interactions
2- Human Adenovirus protein interactions 

The detail description of these interaction datasets is as follows:

Each directory contains two Files:

1- Negative Interactions (Interactions of Human and virus proteins obtained by randomly pairing each human protein 
				against each virus protein and by removing positive (known) Interaction)
2- Positive Interactions (Known interactions of proteins of human and viruses obtained from the publically 
				available protein interaction databases)

Each of these files contain information in following format:

Host_protein_id (1st column)		Virus_protein_id (2nd column) (Interacting Pair)

Sequences of these protein against each id can be obtained from Uniprot at: http://www.uniprot.org/
